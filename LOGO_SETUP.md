# Logo Setup for Splash Screen

## Adding Your Logo

To display your AMIDHARA BOREWELL logo on the splash screen:

1. **Save your logo** as `amidhara-logo.png` or `amidhara-logo.jpg`
2. **Place it** in the `/public/images/` folder
3. **The splash screen will automatically display it**

## Logo Specifications

- **Recommended format**: PNG (with transparency) or JPG
- **Recommended size**: 400x400px or larger
- **File size**: Under 500KB for fast loading
- **File name**: `amidhara-logo.png` or `amidhara-logo.jpg`

## File Location

```
public/
  images/
    amidhara-logo.png  (or .jpg)
```

## Note

If the logo file is not found, the splash screen will still work with the 3D animated logo. The image logo is optional but recommended for branding.
